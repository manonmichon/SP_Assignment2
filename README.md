# About the repository 
This repository is set up to store all the files needed for assignment 2 of the course scientific programming with the master Systems Biology in Maastricht University, given by Egon Willighagen

All files can be found in the master branch. 

The goal of the files in this repository is to find out whether the boiling points of aliphatic alkanes can be predicted using a Partial Least Squares (PLS) model. The model is built in Rstudio in an R file. The report around the code and the model is written in an Rmarkdown file. The visualisation of the Rmarkdown file occurs in an html file.

# Files in this repository
_'Rscript.R'_: An R-file containing solely the code for this project. The code is copied from the rmd file and is thus identical to the code in the report. This was done in case a closer look into the code is required without the interruption of the text in the rmd.
_'Rmarkdown_Assignment2.Rmd'_: An R-markdown file containing the background and explanation of the project, including the code itself.
_'Rmarkdown_Assignment2.hmtl'_: An hmtl version of the R-markdown file 'Rmarkdown_Assignment2.Rmd'. The html can be viewed by clicking here: <a href="https://manonmichon.github.io/SP_Assignment2/Rmarkdown_Assignment2.html">the online version of the html file</a>, or by downloading the file and opening it in a browser.
